				<p> Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few months, you know that racial tensions have been reaching a breaking point in US History with more calls for action than ever before. But for someone who hasn't experienced the effects of racism, it may not seem like an issue that is involved in every aspect of our lives. And for someone who has experienced or witnessed racism, many of the effects of racial prejudice are so deeply embedded into our institutions that we sometimes don't even notice these disparities.</p>

<p>The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement this year has caused many people to step back and examine the nuances of racism that exist in their everyday lives and question what steps they can take to help. With such a heavy topic, it can be difficult to know where to start, so I've broken it down for you and put it layman's terms.</p>
