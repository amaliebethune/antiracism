<h1> Let's Talk About Racism </h1>
<p> Talking about racism is one of the best ways that you can help work towards fixing it. Many people avoid the topic due to fear of offending people or lack of knowledge on the topic. Before you talk to anyone about racism, make sure you do your research first.</p>

<p> A great opportunity to help others understand the weight of their words is stepping in when someone uses a racial slur or a microaggression. Especially with things like microagressions, many people don't even realize the racist notions of their words so pointing it out may be helpful.</p>

<p> Disclaimer: I would not recommend speaking to people about racism if they seem aggressive or if you are a poc, this guide is meant for white people looking for ways to help. As always, read the room and avoid potentially dangerous situations</p>

<p> Here is an example of such a conversation. </p>

<div class="box sb1">Stacy is really pretty for a Black girl.</div>
<div class="box sb2">No, she's just a really pretty girl.</div>
<div class="box sb1">What's wrong with saying "for a Black girl"?</div>
<div class="box sb2">When you say "for a Black girl" your words indicate that it is uncommon for a Black girl to be pretty and that she is only pretty within her race when that isn't true. She is pretty as is. You don't have to mention someone's race or compare them to other people to give them a compliment.</div>
<div class="box sb1"> Well I didn't mean it like that, I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think she would be offended. </div>
<div class="box sb2"> Next time, if you're giving someone a compliment, don't mention their race or modify the compliment because of their race. You could have really hurt Stacy's feelings if you'd have said that to her. </div>
<div class="box sb1"> I don't like being compared to other people, so I guess you're right that it is backhanded to do it to her. I won't say that anymore.</div>
